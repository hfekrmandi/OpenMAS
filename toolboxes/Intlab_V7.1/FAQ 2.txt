>>> The system comes to a hard stop and/or core dump.

    The fastest way to change the rounding mode is chosen. This may be
    by the built-in Matlab function "feature" or by some of the assembly
    routines. In very rare cases it happened what should be blocked by
    Matlab, namely the system goes to a hard stop and/or core dump.
    In that case go to intvalinit.m in the directory intval and change
    the value of the variable TESTROUNDING from 0 to 1. 
    If you are an expert you see which of the assembly routines caused
    the problem; remove it and it should work.
    Otherwise please send me the screen shot and I will try to help.
    Sorry for the inconvenience; it happened only two or three times
    in several thousand installations.


>>> Solving nonlinear systems with verifynlss does not work

    Often a nonlinear system has paramaters which vary in a certain interval.
    For example, an INTLAB user asked me, why verifynlss(@g,ones(2,1)) always
    gives NaN as answer for the following simple function:

       function y=g(x)
       y=x;
       k=infsup(0.5,1);
       y(1)=x(1)*x(2)-k;
       y(2)=x(1)^2-x(2)-2;
       end

    The problem is that calling the function g with a real, non-interval argument
    always gives an interval result. Please use instead:

       function y = g(x)
       y = x;
       k = typeadj( infsup(0.5,1) , typeof(x) );
       y(1) = x(1)*x(2)-k;
       y(2) = x(1)^2-x(2)-2;
       end

    This adjusts the type of "k" to the type of the input "x". It is necessary 
    because verifynlss first performs a Newton iteration, which converges only
    for point  (non-interval) data. 
    When calling the new function we obtain:

       >> verifynlss(@testverifynlss,ones(2,1))
       intval ans = 
       [    1.5232,    1.6243] 
       [    0.3218,    0.6314] 

    so that the nonlinear system [ x1*x2-p ; x1^2-x2-2 ] = 0 has a solution
    within the computed bounds for all p in the interval [0.5,1].



>>> What about the overestimation in the 'FastIVMult'-mode

    The multiplication of interval matrices is much faster when first converting
    to mid-rad mode than in inf-sup mode. However, with the faster mid-rad mode
    there is a worst case overestimation of the result of a factor 1.5 in radius.

    Note that this overestimation is the worst case. For not too wide intervals
    the overestimation is marginal. Consider 

    >> a=reshape(1:4,2,2); A=midrad(a,1e-2)
    intval A =
    [    0.9899,    1.0101] [    2.9899,    3.0101]
    [    1.9899,    2.0101] [    3.9899,    4.0101]

    This matrix has an input tolerance of 1e-2. Multiplication in inf-sup mode yields
    >> intvalinit('sharpivmult'); S=A*A
    ===> Slow but sharp interval matrix multiplication in use
    intval S =
    [    6.9301,    7.0703] [   14.8901,   15.1103]
    [    9.9101,   10.0903] [   21.8701,   22.1303]

    Multiplication in mid-rad mode yields
    >> intvalinit('fastivmult'); F=A*A
    ===> Fast interval matrix multiplication in use (maximum overestimation
             maximally factor 1.5 in radius)
    intval F =
    [    6.9297,    7.0703] [   14.8897,   15.1103]
    [    9.9097,   10.0903] [   21.8697,   22.1303]

    The difference is negligible: 
    >> relerr(S), relerr(S,F)
    ans =
         0.0100    0.0073
         0.0090    0.0059
    ans =
       1.0e-004 *
         0.2886    0.1343
         0.2018    0.0914


>>> Rounding problems

    In older Matlab versions, a system variable BLAS_VERSION had to be set to 
      some atlas version or to refblas. This changed with newer Matlab versions.
    If, in particular, if Matlab R2008a does not start at all but an error window
       "csrot" with text "The specified procedure could not be found"
    appears, you may have used INTLAB before and set the environment variable 
      BLAS_VERSION.
    Please delete this environment variable, and INTLAB should work.
    With new routines for changing the rounding mode INTLAB should work on any
      operating system with the default Intel Math Kernel Library (IMKL).
    Many thanks to Dr. Takeshi Ogita from Tokyo for that!


>>> Rounding problems with Intel Math Kernel library

    In newer versions of Matlab IMKL works without problems.
    In older versions, Matlab choose to use IMKL as default for BLAS operations.
    The IMKL library takes full control over the control word forcing internal
    computation to be done in extended and setting the rounding mode to nearest.
    After return to Matlab the control word is reset to its previous value.

    This has peculiar consequences. For example, the results res1 and res2 in

       x = randn(3,1), res1 = x'*x, res2 = x(1)*x(1)+x(2)*x(2)+x(3)*x(3)

    should mathematically be equal. However, res1 is a dot product and computed
    by IMKL, so the intermediate sums are accumulated in extended precision, whereas
    the second result res2 is computed by conventional multiplication and addition
    in Matlab, so intermediate sums are accumulated in double precision. Note
    this peculiarity occurs in ordinary Matlab and has nothing to do with INTLAB.

    Even worse, in older versions of Matlab the switching of the rounding mode
    does not work with IMKL. Therefore, INTLAB cannot work with IMKL. Consider, 
    for example,
    
       x = 0.1*ones(2,1); d = diam(x'*intval(x))

    The diamater d should not be zero due to rounding errors in the computation of
    diam(x'*intval(x)). If d==0, then you have a older version of Matlab and use
    the IMKL. 
    Fortunately, there is no problem with newer versions of Matlab. 
    In order to make INTLAB work properly with an older version of Matlab, you have 
    to change to another BLAS library, for instance to the Atlas library which was 
    used in previous Matlab versions.
    Unfortunately, I cannot do that from Matlab but the user has to do that outside
    Matlab as a system configuration. 

    For that you have to change the environment variable BLAS_VERSION. From Matlab 
    release notes:

       "If you want to take advantage of the potential performance enhancements 
        provided by the Intel BLAS, you can set the value of the environment 
        variable BLAS_VERSION to the name of the MKL library, mkl.dll. 
        MATLAB uses the BLAS specified by this environment variable, if it exists. 
        To set the BLAS_VERSION environment variable, follow this procedure: Click 
        the Start button, go to the Settings menu, and select Control Panel. On the 
        Control Panel menu, select System. In the System Properties dialog box, 
        click the Advanced tab. On the Advanced panel, click the Environment Variables 
        button. In the Environment Variables dialog box, click the New button in the 
        User variables section. In the New User Variable dialog box, enter the name 
        of the variable as BLAS_VERSION and set the value of the variable to the name 
        of the MKL library: mkl.dll. "

    Please consult 
 
       http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/rn/r14sp1_math_new.html
 
    and "Overriding the Default BLAS Library on Sun/Solaris Systems". 

    So change the system variable BLAS_VERSION to atlas*** choosing '***' according to 
    your processor. You find the atlas files in matlab/bin/win32 . I can't do that from
    INTLAB, sorry for inconvenience.

    To get visual feedback that the BLAS version has changed, also type at the UNIX prompt
 
       % setenv LAPACK_VERBOSITY 1
 
    before starting MATLAB to display diagnostic information while MATLAB is starting 
    up.
 


>>> Strange behaviour when converting numbers (Thanks to Georgios E. Fainekos for 
       pointing to this problem).

    Note that it is not safe to change the rounding mode and use Matlab's
    conversion of decimal numbers into floating-point. In rounding to 
    nearest, we can expect that the result of, for example,

       x = 0.33

    to be a floating-point number x near the decimal number 0.33 (note that
    decimal 0.33 is not representable as a finite binary number). However,
    when changing the rounding mode, Matlab's behaviour is not defined and
    is unpredictable. For example, start Matlab afresh and compute

       >> setround(-1), x=0.33
       x =
           0.3300
       >> setround(-1), y=0.33
       y =
           0.3300

     Everything looks as expected. However, 

        >> setround(0), x-y
        ans =
          5.5511e-017

    Instead, please use 

       X = intval('0.33')

    or alike, this is safe in any rounding mode and does what you may expect.       



>>> Erroneous inclusion when using Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem

    There is an option intvalinit('RealStdFctsExcptnIgnore') which may 
    have been set. With this option input arguments out of range are ignored,
    see Readme.txt and the demo on interval arithmetic. For example,
       X = infsup(-3,4); Y = sqrt(X)
    yields 
       Y = [0,2] 
    as result ignoring the fact that part of X, namely [-2,0) is not in the 
    (real) range of definition of sqrt. 
    For a continuous function f:R^n->R^n and a nonempty, compact and convex set 
    X in R^n we know by Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem that f has a fixed point 
    in X provided X is mapped into itself by f. 
    Now consider f(x):=sqrt(x)-2. Obviously, there is no real x such that f(x)=x.
    However, f(X)=[-2,0] when ignoring input arguments out of range, so that
    one might falsely conclude that f(X) is contained X !
    The additional check
       flag = intvalinit('RealStdFctsExcptnOccurred')
    will yield flag=1 in the example, revealing that f(X) need only contain the
    set of f(x) for x in X _and_ in the range of definition of f. 
    For more details, see Readme.txt and the demo on interval arithmetic.



>>> Peculiar messages involving 'numel' or even core dump

    There is a known bug in Matlab 7.0.1 and 7.0.4. Try
        feature accel off
    for cure.



>>> Peculiar behaviour when debugging

    Note that rounding is reset to nearest when setting breakpoints.



>>> Wrong inclusion?

    This would be about the worst what could happen for a verification routine.
    Recently I was trapped in my test programs by the following. The test was for
    the sum of intervals.
    It seems natural to generate some vector x of dimension n, sum up the elements
    in a for-loop and check against sum(x). However, the for-loop uses the Matlab-
    commands, rounding the intermediate results to double precision, whereas sum(x)
    uses the IMKL-library, on PCs summing up in extended precision. So the results
    need to coincide. Even worse, for a vector x of floating-point numbers, it may
    happen that the for-loop sum is not included in sum(intval(x)).



>>> Interval matrix multiplication seems not correct

Consider


A=infsup([-1,-5;2,3],[1,-4;2,5]), B=A*A, A(1,1)*A(1,2)+A(1,2)*A(2,2) 

intval A =
[   -1.0000,    1.0000] [   -5.0000,   -4.0000]
[    2.0000,    2.0000] [    3.0000,    5.0000]
intval B =
[  -11.0000,   -7.0000] [  -30.0000,   -6.0000]
[    4.0000,   12.0000] [   -3.0000,   17.0000]
intval ans =
[  -30.0000,   -7.0000]


Here the (1,2)-component of B=A*A is too wide. The default is 

intvalinit('FastIVmult')
===> Fast interval matrix multiplication in use (maximum overestimation
          factor 1.5 in radius)

for fast matrix multiplication of two interval matrices. For sharp results,
try

intvalinit('SharpIVmult')
A=infsup([-1,-5;2,3],[1,-4;2,5]), B=A*A, A(1,1)*A(1,2)+A(1,2)*A(2,2)

===> Slow but sharp interval matrix multiplication in use
intval A =
[   -1.0000,    1.0000] [   -5.0000,   -4.0000]
[    2.0000,    2.0000] [    3.0000,    5.0000]
intval B =
[  -11.0000,   -7.0000] [  -30.0000,   -7.0000]
[    4.0000,   12.0000] [   -1.0000,   17.0000]
intval ans =
[  -30.0000,   -7.0000]

There is only a difference if both factors are of nonzero diameter. In that case,
however, 'sharp' multiplication is pretty slow for larger dimensions:

Time in seconds for multiplication of full interval matrices, almost all entries
zero intervals, on an Intel i7, 2.8 GHz Laptop:

       n       FastIVmult     SharpIVmult
    ----------------------------------------
      500         0.108           3.8   
     2000         3.6           278     
     5000        54            4193     

For sparse matrices with 5 % density, all entries zero intervals:

       n       FastIVmult     SharpIVmult
    ----------------------------------------
      500         0.063          0.18  
     2000         1.5            9.1   
     5000        14            227

>>> Intervals are not working correctly

    You might have used the following:

    >> Z=[1,2]+i*[-1,1]
    Z =
      1.0000 - 1.0000i   2.0000 + 1.0000i
  
    The brackets in the definition of Z might lead to the conclusion that Z is a 
    complex interval (rectangle) with lower left endpoint 1-i and upper right 
    endpoint 2+i. This is not the case. The above statement is a standard Matlab
    statement defining a (row) vector of length 2. It cannot be an interval:
    Otherwise Z would be preceded in the output by "intval".

    This has been fixed in the new release

>>> Problems with gradient

    Matlab version 7 has its own function 'gradient' for approximating derivatives.
    This creates a conflict with our toolbox. Of course, one may rename or copy the
    Matlab routine, but then functions are not compatible with Matlab without INTLAB.
    If anybody knows a clue, please let me know.



>>> SparseInfNanFlag problems

    This has been fixed in the new release



>>> Interval output too wide

    We claim that INTLAB output of intervals is correct in any format, that means,
    the displayed (decimal) numbers form an inclusion of the computed interval.
    For example,

    >> format short; X = intval(2)/3;
    >> infsup(X), midrad(X), disp_(X)
    intval X = 
    [    0.6666,    0.6667] 
    intval X = 
    <    0.6667,   0.0001>   
    intval X = 
        0.6666

    In short format, the displayed [ 0.6666 , 0.6667 ] is the best possible. For
    display with "_" see "help disp_". 
    
    The next example may seem strange:
    >> format short e, midrad(X), diam(X)
    intval X = 
    <  6.6667e-001, 3.3334e-006> 
    ans =
      1.1102e-016

    So the displayed radius 3.3334e-006 seems much to big. However, it is about
    best possible for the _displayed_ midpoint! 

    But the displayed results are not always best (i.e. as narrow as) possible.
    Consider (thanks to John Pryce for pointing to this)
    
    >> format short, intvalinit('Displayinfsup'), m=succ(0), M=realmax, infsup(m,M)
    ===> Default display of intervals by infimum/supremum (e.g. [ 3.14 , 3.15 ])
    m =
      4.9407e-324
    M =
      1.7977e+308
    intval ans = 
      1.0e+308 *
    [    0.0000,       Inf] 

    This is improvable. Even worse

    >> m8=8*m, infsup(m8,M)
    m8 =
      3.9525e-323
    intval ans = 
      1.0e+308 *
    [    0.0000,       Inf]

    Well, a conversion always accurate to the last digit is a nontrivial task. We used
    a very simple way of conversion, poor men's conversion so to speak. To display some 
    number we convert it into a decimal string using the built-in Matlab routine. Then
    the displayed result is rounded back into floating point. Then correctness with 
    respect to the intended rounding is checked. If not correct, the same procedure is
    performed for a value slightly larger (or smaller) than the given number [see
    S.M. Rump: INTLAB - INTerval LABoratory, in "Developments in Reliable Computing", 
    ed. T. Csendes, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 77-104 (1999)].

    In many if not most cases the displayed result is indeed best possible. For bounds
    near to the underflow or overflow range this is not true. However, at least the
    displayed bounds are correct. So in such cases please check the individual bounds.

    We know that this approach may not be completely satisfactory. Volunteers having a
    better solution, written in Matlab, are very welcome.
