Since random matrices are generally well-conditioned, this is no real challenge concerning verification of the result.</p><p>Here and in the following we display the computing time for the Matlab built-in solver and for our verification routines. Note that this compares apples with oranges: the results of the verification routine are mathematically proved to be correct, including all rounding errors and the proof of non-singularity of the input matrix, wheras approximations are sometimes not correct, even without warning (see e.g. the section "Larger least squares problems").</p><p>Following the computing time for the Matlab solver A\b and for the verification INTLAB algorithm verifylss, some components of the solution as well as the minimum and median number of correct digits is displayed.</p><pre class="codeinput">format <span class="string">short</span>

%% DEMOINTLAB_LARGER  Some larger examples with INTLAB
% Designed and written by Siegfried M. Rump, head of the Institute for Reliable Computing, Hamburg University of Technology.
% For more information, see www.ti3.tuhh.de

%% Welcome to INTLAB, the Matlab toolbox for Reliable Computing 
% Following are some larger examples using INTLAB, the Matlab toolbox for Reliable Computing. 
% All computations are on my 2.8 GHz Laptop using Matlab R2010b under Windows.
%
%% Dense linear systems
% The following generates a dense linear system with n=5000 unknowns randomly 
% with solution approximately all 1's.
% Since random matrices are generally well-conditioned, this is no real
% challenge concerning verification of the result. 
%
% Here and in the following we display the computing time for the Matlab 
% built-in solver and for our verification routines. Note that this compares
% apples with oranges: the results of the verification routine are
% mathematically proved to be correct, including all rounding errors and
% the proof of non-singularity of the input matrix, wheras approximations
% are sometimes not correct, even without warning (see e.g. the section
% "Larger least squares problems").
%
% Following the computing time for
% the Matlab solver A\b and for the verification INTLAB algorithm verifylss, 
% some components of the solution as well as the minimum and median number 
% of correct digits is displayed.

%%
% Since the right hand side b is computed as A*x in floating-point, the
% true solution is approximately the vector of 1's, but not exactly. To
% force the solution to include the vector of 1's, the right hand side is
% computed as an inclusion of A*b. Such methods are often used as tests for
% verification algorithms.

%%
% The computing time is roughly the same, but the inclusion is less
% accurate. However, the right hand side is now an interval vector, and the
% solution of _all_ linear systems with a right hand side within bb
% is included. 
% 
% For cond(A)~10^k, according to the well-known rule of thumb in numerical analyis, the
% accuracy of the inclusion should be roughly the number of correct digits
% in bb minus k. This is indeed true.

accX = median(r)
median(relacc(bb)) - log10(cond(A))

%% Ill-conditioned dense linear systems
% Next an ill-conditioned linear system with n=5000 unknowns is generated
% with solution again roughly the vector of 1's. The condition number
% is approximately 10^14.
%
% The computing time for
% the Matlab solver A\b and for the verification INTLAB algorithm verifylss, 
% some components of the solution as well as the minimum and median number 
% of correct digits is displayed. 
%
% The condition number implies that the accuracy of the inclusion should be
% roughly 16-14 = 2 correct digits. This indeed true.

%% Sparse linear systems I
% By the principle of the used method, mainly symmetric positive definite
% matrices can be treated. The performance for general sparse matrices is
% not good; alas, basically no better method is known.
%
% Consider for example matrix #356 from the Florida matrix market of 
% dimension 52,329 with 2.6 million nonzero elements. The matrix looks as follows.

Prob = UFget(356);   
A = Prob.A;
n = size(A,1)
b = A*ones(n,1);

spy(A)

% We display the timing the Matlab solver and the verification routine
% verifylss, and show the minimum and median accuracy of the inclusion.
% Note that the estimated condition number is 2e14.

%% Sparse linear systems II
% Sometimes the verification routine is about as fast or even faster than 
% the built-in Matlab solver. The test matrix is #938 from the Florida matrix market.
% This matrix has dimension 36,000 with about 14 million nonzero
% elements.

% The accuracy of the inclusion is as expected. We mention that verifylss

% accelarates the method, but not always. For completeness we list the
% computing time of the approximate solver with this preordering.

%% Larger least squares problems
% We first generate a dense 5000x500 matrix with condition number 1e12
% to solve the corresponding least squares problem. The right hand side 
% is the vector of 1's. The computing time of
% the built-in Matlab solver and the verification routine is displayed.

tic
X = verifylss(A,b);
disp(sprintf('Time for the verification algorithm %5.1f [sec]',toc))

%%
% Next we show some components of the approximate solution computed x by Matlab and
% the verified inclusion X by INTLAB. Note that some 15 digits are 
% verified to be correct, so we can judge that the Matlab approximation
% has only about 1 or 2 correct digits. The Matlab approximation comes without
% warning.

%% Sparse least squares problems
% Following we display the timing and accuracy of the built-in Matlab
% routine and the verification routine verifylss for a larger least squares
% problem, namely matrix #2201. This is a problem with 37932 for 331
% unknowns and about 130 thousand nonzero elements. The right hand side is
% again the vector of 1's.

% In this case we can judge from the inclusion that about 13 digits of the
% approximation are correct.

%% Verified solution of a larger nonlinear system
% The following example was proposed by Abbot and Brent and is 
% implemented in the function test.
%

%%
%  function y = test(x)
%  % Abbot/Brent     3 y" y + y'^2 = 0;    y(0)=0; y(1)=20;
%  % approximation   10*ones(n,1)
%  % solution        20*x^.75
%    y = x;
%    n = length(x); v=2:n-1;
%    y(1) = 3*x(1)*(x(2)-2*x(1)) + x(2)*x(2)/4;
%    y(v) = 3*x(v).*(x(v+1)-2*x(v)+x(v-1)) + (x(v+1)-x(v-1)).^2/4;
%    y(n) = 3*x(n).*(20-2*x(n)+x(n-1)) + (20-x(n-1)).^2/4;

% An inclusion of the solution for 5000 unknowns is computed. The timing,
% some components of the inclusion and the accuracy of the solution is displayed.
